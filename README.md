Note: You need to replace your_client_id, your_client_secret, your_username, your_password, and opponent_username with your actual credentials and the opponent's username.

Also, note that this code sends a challenge to the opponent by creating a dictionary with the is_ranked, opponent, and game_settings fields, and sending it to the server using the requests.post() method. Once the opponent accepts the challenge, the server sends a message with the game_state field set to 'play', indicating that the game has started. At this point, the code prints the board using a custom print_board() function (which you need to define), and sends a move.

You'll need to replace the dummy vertex 'D4' with the actual vertex you want to play, based on your strategy. Also, you'll need to define the print_board() function to print the board in a human-readable format.
